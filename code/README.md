- **01_data_gathering.ipynb**

> This notebook is where I scrape and format the data to be used in the rest of the notebooks.

- **02_anomaly_detection.ipynb**

> This notebook is used to identify highlights using z-score thresholding and Markov chains.

- **03_topic_modeling.ipynb**

> The notebook wherein I use topic modeling via LDA to identify highlights. Unfortunately, this process has not yet been factored out into its own script.

- **04_video_editing.ipynb**

> Some quick code to chop up a VOD according to the highlights found in `02_anomaly_detection.ipynb` or `03_topic_modeling.ipynb`.

- **highlighter.py**

> Python script for highlighting based on the techniques used in `02_anomaly_detection.ipynb`, as well as a couple helper methods to find the start and end times of the clips that are generated.

- **twitch_chat_format.py**

> Python script for formatting a `.log` file generated by `twitch_chat_scrape.py` into a Pandas-workable format, as well as finding the message-per-second data.

- **twitch_chat_scrape.py**

> Python script for the scraping of a live Twitch stream and writing the output to a `.log` file.
